            <p>Hello! My name is Mary Stoddard and I live in Eagle Mountain, Utah. I enjoy reading, baking, and playing with my pets. I have eight siblings that are all pretty awesome. They are: Hannah, James, Leah, Asael, Isaiah, Ephraim, Ezra, and Eliza. I hopt to one day become a software engineer. My dad was a software engineer and I think that would be a pretty cool job to have that also makes a decent amount of money. I have always been interested in programming, coding, etc., things like that.</p>

            <p>I really love my state. It is located in the western US and has a lot of variety. There are really cool places like St. George that have really cool red rocks and places like where I live with really pretty mountains.</p>
